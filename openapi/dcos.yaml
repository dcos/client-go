      description: "This endpoint provides the IAM's JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), exposing

        token verification: the public key material can be used for verifying
        authentication tokens signed by the IAM's private key. The DC/OS
        authentication token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) of type RS256, and is
        required to have the two claims `exp` and `uid`. For interpretation of
        the data provided by the JWKS endpoint see

        depends on the IAM configuration (only, i.e. the lifetime cannot be
        chosen as part of the login HTTP request). The DC/OS authentication
        token can be verified out-of-band using a standards-compliant RS256 JWT
        verification procedure based on the long-lived public key material
        presented by the IAM's /auth/jwks endpoint, and by requiring the two
